	    <note publish="yes">This text retains Harrington's spelling in some cases. For example, writing double consonants, writing a small y and w for consonants that have these sounds following them, and writing some small words together as one word. Long vowels, ', ch, th, sh, and accent (where possible) are written using the current spelling system.</note><!-- add note about glottal marks when we figure out what's going on-->
