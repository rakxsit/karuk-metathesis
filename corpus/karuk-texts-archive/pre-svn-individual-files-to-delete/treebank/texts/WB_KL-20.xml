		<note publish="yes">Bright: "This version of the Weasel story could not be obtained entirely in Karok, since the informant kept switching into English in spite of herself. The lacunae in the Karok text are indicated by dots (. . .); a condensation of the English material which the informant supplied at these points is given, set off by parentheses, in the translation."</note>

				<note>In Bright, there is an unexpected difference of accent between nivâaram in this sentence and (what was written as) niváaram in the previous sentence. In Bright's notebooks, he writes the nivaaram in 2 as nivâaram, so I assume the acute accent in the published text is an error and I have corrected it.</note>
