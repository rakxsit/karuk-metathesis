Notes from 2020.05.27

- Some audio had to be manually filled in because the xml tag couldnt be found (wrong extension, etc.)
	- CT-02 (tagged with amp extension)

- Some of the audio files are two channel, causing errors, so I extracted just the left channel (they are in twochannel-audio). These include the followoing folders:
	- CT-02
	- LA-01
	- LA-03 (except for LA-03_09
	- SD-03
	- VS-21

- Some files couldn't align
	- VS-29 : karuk-2010-05-01-arg-edited-2_14

- Some issues with aligning the first time but ok after
	- VS-39
	- WB_KL-13

- Cannot align--something about sampling rates being different? (in ALIGNMENT-ISSUES)
	- WB_LA78.1-004b
	- WB_LA78.1-009
